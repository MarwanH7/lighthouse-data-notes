# Miniproject 2

### [Assignment](assignment.md)

## Project/Goals

In this project the goal is to go though the Extract,Transform, Load (ETL) process and build a database with various points of interest (POIs) information. 


## Process

* Extract data using API requests from [Foursquare](https://developer.foursquare.com/) and [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3)
* Process and organise data to fit the projects needs & requirments 
* Move transformed Data into a created database 


## Results

* Both API'S had amazing coverage, about a varaity POI'S, I mainly focused and filtered for restaurants and retreived details such as :resaurants names, location, ratings, review counts,hours of work  and websites
* In conclusion I personally found that the foursquare API was simpler to use, and needed less Api requested to aquire the same amounts of data yelp provided.

## Challenges 

The most challenging and time consuming part is figuring out the API documenation trying to figure out which parts you need and which parts you don't and what they mean. I'd say retrieving the data from different API sources becausse there seems to be no method to the madness !! 


## Future Goals

I would have liked to work more on the stretch part of this project if I had a little bit more time.
